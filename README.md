Repository for my code


Feel free to use anything you find here for whatever you'd like. Most of my scripts are built to run alongside the LINKS Mark II AI by MVC (http://mega-voice-command.com/) but I'm sure they can modified for other purposes as well. 



Send any feedback/bugs/etc.. good OR bad to duroktar@gmail.com I appreciate it all!

Thanks, traBpUkciP


And if you're feeling exceptionally generous today, feel free to buy me a coffee! Because coffee makes the code compile.
