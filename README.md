# cookbook
Repository for my code

**Quick link to the MVC Links Mark II stuff https://github.com/Duroktar/cookbook/tree/master/Python/LINKS**

Most of my scripts are built to run alongside the LINKS Mark II AI by MVC (http://mega-voice-command.com/) but I'm sure they can modified for other purposes as well. If any sources weren't mentioned in the scripts please let me know and I can correct it.

Send any feedback/bugs/etc.. good OR bad to duroktar@gmail.com I appreciate it all!

Thanks, traBpUkciP


And if you're feeling extra nice today, feel free to buy me a coffee! Because coffee makes the code compile.
